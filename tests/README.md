# BPFtrace Tests

There are two test suites in the project.

## Unit tests

These tests can be run with the `bpftrace_test` executable.

The code generation tests are based on the output of LLVM 5, so may give errors if run with different version. They can be excluded by running:

`bpftrace_test --gtest_filter=-codegen*`

## Runtime tests

  Runtime tests will call the bpftrace executable.
  * Run: `sudo make runtime-tests` inside your build folder
  * By default, runtime-tests will look for the executable in the build folder. You can set a value to the environment variable `BPFTRACE_RUNTIME_TEST_EXECUTABLE` to customize it
