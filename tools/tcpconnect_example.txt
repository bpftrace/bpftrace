Demonstrations of tcpconnect, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.


This tool traces the kernel function performing active TCP connections
(eg, via a connect() syscall; accept() are passive connections). Some example
output (IP addresses changed to protect the innocent):

# ./tcpconnect.bt
TIME     PID      COMM             SADDR          SPORT  DADDR          DPORT
00:36:45 1798396  agent            127.0.0.1      5001   10.229.20.82   56114
00:36:45 1798396  curl             127.0.0.1      10255  10.229.20.82   56606
00:36:45 3949059  nginx            127.0.0.1      8000   127.0.0.1      37780


This output shows three connections, one from a "agent" process, one from
"curl", and one from "redis-cli". The output details shows the IP version, source
address, source socket port, destination address, and destination port. This traces attempted
connections: these may have failed.

The overhead of this tool should be negligible, since it is only tracing the
kernel functions performing connect. It is not tracing every packet and then
filtering.

USAGE message:

# ./tcpconnect.bt
