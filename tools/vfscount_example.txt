Demonstrations of vfscount, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.


Tracing all VFS calls:

# ./vfscount.bt
Attaching 54 probes...
cannot attach kprobe, Invalid argument
Warning: could not attach probe kprobe:vfs_dedupe_get_page.isra.21, skipping.
Tracing VFS calls... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

@[vfs_fsync_range]: 4
@[vfs_readlink]: 14
@[vfs_statfs]: 56
@[vfs_lock_file]: 60
@[vfs_write]: 276
@[vfs_statx]: 328
@[vfs_statx_fd]: 394
@[vfs_open]: 541
@[vfs_getattr]: 595
@[vfs_getattr_nosec]: 597
@[vfs_read]: 1113

While tracing, the vfs_read() call was the most frequent, occurring 1,113 times.

VFS is the Virtual File System: a kernel abstraction for file systems and other
resources that expose a file system interface. Much of VFS maps directly to the
syscall interface. Tracing VFS calls gives you a high level breakdown of the
kernel workload, and starting points for further investigation.

Notet that a warning was printed: "Warning: could not attach probe
kprobe:vfs_dedupe_get_page.isra.21": these are not currently instrumentable by
bpftrace/kprobes, so a warning is printed to let you know that they will be
missed.


There is another version of this tool in bcc: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
