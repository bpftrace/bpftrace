Demonstrations of tcpretrans, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.


This tool traces the kernel TCP retransmit function to show details of these
retransmits. For example:

# ./tcpretrans.bt
TIME     PID      NETNS               LADDR:LPORT           RADDR:RPORT  STATE
21:54:32 0        4026531992    192.168.5.1:29716     192.168.5.2:80     SYN_SENT
21:54:36 0        4026531992    192.168.5.1:29718     192.168.5.2:80     SYN_SENT
21:54:36 59827    4026532261    192.168.5.2:80        192.168.5.1:29718  ESTABLISHED

This output shows three TCP retransmits, the first two were for an IPv4
connection from 192.168.5.1 to 192.168.5.2 port 80. The TCP state was
"SYN_SENT" at the time of the retransmit. The on-CPU PID at the time of
the retransmit is printed, in this case 0 (the kernel, which will
be the case most of the time). The NETNS column shows which netns this
connection belongs.

Retransmits are usually a sign of poor network health, and this tool is
useful for their investigation. Unlike using tcpdump, this tool has very
low overhead, as it only traces the retransmit function. It also prints
additional kernel details: the state of the TCP session at the time of the
retransmit.

USAGE message:
