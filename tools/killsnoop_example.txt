Demonstrations of killsnoop, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.



This traces signals sent via the kill() syscall. For example:

# ./killsnoop.bt
Attaching 3 probes...
Tracing kill() signals... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
TIME      PID    COMM             SIG  TPID   RESULT
00:09:37  22485  bash             2    23856  0
00:09:40  22485  bash             2    23856  -3
00:09:31  22485  bash             15   23814  -3

The first line showed a SIGINT (2) sent from PID 22485 (a bash shell) to
PID 23856. The result, 0, means success. The next line shows the same signal
sent, which resulted in -3, a failure (likely because the target process
no longer existed).


There is another version of this tool in bcc: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
The bcc version provides command line options to customize the output.
