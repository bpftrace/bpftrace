Demonstrations of statsnoop, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.


statsnoop traces different stat() syscalls system-wide, and prints details.
Example output:

# statsnoop.bt
Attaching 9 probes...
Tracing stat syscalls... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

This output has caught me mistyping a command in another shell, "iconfig"
instead of "ifconfig". The first several lines show the bash shell searching
the $PATH (why is games in my $PATH??), and failing to find it (ERR == 2 is
file not found). Then, a "command-not-found" program executes (the name is
truncated to 16 characters in the COMM field, including the NULL), which
begins the process of searching for and suggesting a package. ie, this:

# iconfig
The program 'iconfig' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
apt install ipmiutil

statsnoop can be used for general debugging, to see what file information has
been requested, and whether those files exist. It can be used as a companion
to opensnoop, which shows what files were actually opened.


There is another version of this tool in bcc: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
The bcc version provides options to customize the output.
