/*
 * execsnoop.bt   Trace new processes via exec() syscalls.
 *                For Linux, uses bpftrace and eBPF.
 *
 * This traces when processes call exec(). It is handy for identifying new
 * processes created via the usual fork()->exec() sequence. Note that the
 * return value is not currently traced, so the exec() may have failed.
 *
 * TODO: switch to tracepoints args. Support more args. Include retval.
 *
 * This is a bpftrace version of the bcc tool of the same name.
 *
 * 15-Nov-2017	Brendan Gregg	Created this.
 * 11-Sep-2018	   "     "	Switched to use join().
