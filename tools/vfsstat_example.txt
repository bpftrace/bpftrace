Demonstrations of vfsstat, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.


This traces some common VFS calls (see the script for the list) and prints
per-second summaries.

Each second, a timestamp is printed ("HH:MM:SS") followed by common VFS
functions and the number of calls for that second. While tracing, the vfs_read()
kernel function was most frequent, occurring over 10,000 times per second.


There is another version of this tool in bcc: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
The bcc version provides command line options.
