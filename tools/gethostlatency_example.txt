Demonstrations of gethostlatency, the Linux bpftrace/eBPF version.


This traces host name lookup calls (getaddrinfo(), gethostbyname(), and
gethostbyname2()), and shows the PID and command performing the lookup, the
latency (duration) of the call in milliseconds, and the host string:

# gethostlatency.bt
Attaching 7 probes...
Tracing getaddr/gethost calls... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
TIME      PID    COMM              LATms HOST
02:52:05  19105  curl                 81 www.netflix.com
02:52:12  19111  curl                 17 www.netflix.com
02:52:19  19116  curl                  9 www.facebook.com
02:52:23  19118  curl                  3 www.facebook.com

In this example, the first call to lookup "www.netflix.com" took 81 ms, and
the second took 17 ms (sounds like some caching).


There is another version of this tool in bcc: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc
The bcc version provides options to customize the output.
