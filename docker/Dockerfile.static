# It looks like llvm18 prefers to dynamically link against zstd. Extremely
# unclear why.  Work around it by modifying LLVMExports.cmake.

# bcc-static needs clang/llvm 18 instead of the latest 19. As a consequence,
# CMake reports errors as that it cannot find files in /usr/lib/cmake/clang/ as
# it's a symlink for /usr/lib/cmake/clangXX/ which is only created when the
# latest clang is installed. To fix this, create the symlink manually.
RUN ln -s 'clang18' /usr/lib/cmake/clang
