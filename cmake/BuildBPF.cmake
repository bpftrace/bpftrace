# Functions to build intermediate BPF modules.
#
# The `bpf` function will produce bitcode, an object as well as the BTF type
# information for a given file. The `btf_header` function can be used to
# produce a C header for a given BTF source file (often the kernel, but it
# can be the output from any `bpf` rule, for example).

  # The joys of BPF & debug tooling 101.
  #
  # The purpose for this function is to generate various types of output for a
  # given source file, for testing and embedding purposes:
  #  * LLVM bitcode file compatible with our major version of LLVM.
  #  * A binary annotated with DWARF type information.
  #  * Encoded BTF type information for this source unit.
  #  * A list of functions defined in the file.
  #
  # Naturally, you'd assume that this could be implementated mostly as a chain
  # of steps, save the intermediate results along the way. Wrong! Unfortunately,
  # each of these steps has their own happy path.
  #
  # First, the bitcode. This is actually straight-forward! We need to ensure
  # that this gets built with the correct version of LLVM (not whatever
  # compiler CMAKE has selected) so that it is compatible with the LLVM
  # libraries that we are linking against. We can even correctly select bpf as
  # our target, to get the extent that there is any early specialization.
  #
  # Next, you might assume that taking this bitcode and turning it into a BPF
  # object is the logical thing to do, in order to ensure that all the types
  # are compatible and consistent. In fact, this even *seems* to work. But
  # after banging your head on the keyboard for a while, you'll realize that
  # something is broken. As you contort clang, and try building from scratch,
  # you'll realize that clang seems to generate proper annotations and
  # relocations for loadable programs (the happy path for that!), but fails to
  # generate the same types for base types. In fact, in doesn't even generate
  # named arguments without an explicit `-O2`.  Oh well, I suppose that the
  # common path for the kernel is to build with `gcc` and then rely on the
  # `pahole` conversion. Let's do that.
  #
  # But hold on a second, we said that we wanted to build a BPF target? Turns
  # out that `gcc` can't do that very well. So `clang` can't build our BPF
  # target because of incorrect BTF, and `gcc` can't build the BPF target. So
  # we need to build the source natively, use `pahole` to generate the BTF
  # data, and then extract that separately. This makes some sense, as it is the
  # kernel happy path.
  #
  # But at least what we built above has the DWARF data, right? Wrong! If we
  # were to link the full binary, too much gets stripped out to generate the
  # full set of BTF information. So we need to generate just the object, add
  # BTF information, and separately link that single object into a binary to
  # have the DWARF data in a ELF binary that we're looking for.
  #
  # Finally, we can breath a sight of relief and generate our list of
  # functions. Like the bitcode, this works as expected.
