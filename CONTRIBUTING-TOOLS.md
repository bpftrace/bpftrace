# Contributing bpftrace tools

All new tools must be submitted to the [user-tools repository](https://github.com/bpftrace/user-tools/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) (not here) where they have a chance to develop maturity and collect real world use cases. 

The tools that exist in this repository are a small collection curated by the bpftrace maintainers that have been battle-tested and are packaged with bpftrace. They are also used for testing and validation.

A list of requirements, which is currently under development, for how tools in the user-tools repository get added to the curated list here will be available soon.
